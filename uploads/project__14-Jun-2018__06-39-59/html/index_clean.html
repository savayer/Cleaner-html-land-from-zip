<p> Hi there, I'm Lizzy, I'm 22. Until fairly recently, I suffered from the fact that I had no boyfriend. But finally I met HIM - a handsome, smart, and funny guy, without any drawbacks! But it was just one moment of happiness. It turned out, that perfect guy had  <a href=""> one big problem - </a>... </p>
<p> I met Ben at the student canteen. He was a new student, came from another institute. 
                <b> He attracted attention of all the girls there, but he sat at my table. </b>  We started dating. 
            </p>
<h2> We started dating. </h2>
<p><b> Girls envied me - no wonder, it was great luck to 'catch' such a handsome guy! </b>  Our groupmates were good-for-nothing, ugly and lazy. Everything went too smooth, subconsciously I expected something bad to happen. As it turned out, I was right. </p>
<p> In a week a group of us went to the weekend trip out of town. It was our first night together with Ben. 30 minutes after we fell asleep,  <a href=""> I was awakened by horrible sounds</a>.  </p>
<h2> My first impression was, there was some beast wandering near our house, but in fact it was Ben snoring! </h2>
<div align="center"><img src="img/img1.png"></div>
<p> I've never heard such a thunder in my life.  <b> Even when my uncle drank too much, he didn't snore so loud. </b>  I spent an hour tossing in my bed, kicking him from time to time. But he did not react. My nerves couldn't stand it and I walked outside. It turned out, I was not the only victim. Guys who slept in two neighbouring houses were awake too, because of that terrible snoring. </p>
<p> Over time, I forgot about that. Until the day Ben spent the night at my place. </p>
<h2> As soon as we went to bed, I heard THAT SAME snoring. </h2>
<p> My apartment is small,  <b> which made the sound even louder. </b>  That night, I didn't sleep a single minute. In the morning I went to the institute, feeling awful. I understood that snoring was a lousy reason to break up, but I wasn't particularly 
                <a href=""> pleased with the idea of being deprived of sleep</a>. </p>
<p> We tried a lot of different devices: some pegs to be put on the bridge of the nose, expanders, special nasal drops, even herbal infusions, which, according to my grandmother, will eliminate snoring completely.  <b> But nothing helped! </b></p>
<h2> We stopped spending nights together. </h2>
<p><b> He was mad at me for that, our relationship went downhill. </b>  But right at the point where I was ready to admit that it was the end, I came across a brand new remedy for snoring.  <a href=""> Night Comfort</a> is an oral spray which consists of only natural components.  </p>
<a href=""><div align="center"><img src="img/pack2.png"></div></a>
<p> This product was designed by Swiss scientists.  <b> They found out that certain components can smooth nasal passages. </b></p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p> I was impressed by the number of positive reviews. People wrote that they managed to escape surgery thanks to 
                <a href=""> Night Comfort</a>.  <b> Some even saved their marriage. This was just what I needed, so I ordered the spray at once. </b></p>
<p> When I showed it to Ben, he laughed for a long time, and said he did not understand how it could possibly help him get rid of snoring. But he was tired of failed attempts to cure it, so he agreed to give it a go.  </p>
<p> I waited for him to fall asleep.  </p>
<h2> An hour passed, and Ben didn't make a sound. </h2>
<p> I called him, there followed no reaction - he was fast asleep! For the first time, I had a good night's rest while sleeping together with my boyfriend.  <b> Many won't understand me, but it was a true happiness for me. </b>
</p>
<img class="left_img" src="img/img2.jpg"><p> In the morning, I asked him if it was comfortable, he said he didn't even feel the band. </p>
<p><b> We've been living together ever since. Yesterday Ben proposed to me. </b>  Without a hint of hesitation, I said yes, because he is the best men on earth. </p>
<p>  If any of you have a similar problem, don't think of breaking up with your loved ones, 
                <b> because you can easily get rid of snoring . </b> Below you'll find a link to the site from where you can order  <a href=""> Night Comfort</a>. </p>

<div class="text"> We had the same problem. My husband rocked the house with his snoring, even surgery didn't help. We slept in different rooms for years. Then we learnt about Night Comfort and the problem was gone! Now we are enjoying our second honeymoon)                     </div>

<div class="text">  I bought  <a href=""> Night Comfort</a> for my husband, at first he refused flat to use it. He told me it was no use, that he felt uncomfortable doing something pointless. But he tried it anyway, he was surprised by the result himself. The spray turned out helpful, he fell asleep fast and I had a soundless night. Now he always gets a good night's rest, me too.

<div class="text"> I can easily explain how exactly this spray helps. Recently, scientists proved that snoring depends completely on throat muscles, not the bridge of the nose. This spray is designed to lower snoring volume smoothing membranes in the nasal passages. This thing helped me a lot. I remember I used to wake up by my own snoring, now I sleep like a baby.

<div class="text">  I bought the spray for my father. He suffered from respiratory arrest caused by snoring, my mother was always worried, she couldn't fall asleep. Now he almost doesn't snore at all. His problems with breathing disappeared too.  </div>

<div class="text">  I'm only 27, over the past 8 years I've been suffering from snoring. I got tested, doctors didn't find the reason. Spending nights together with my boyfriend was a problem for me too, what would he think when he learns that his girlfriend snores like a tractor. I bought  <a href=""> Night Comfort</a>. My mum says I virtually stopped snorning. I'm not ashamed of snoring when I spend the night with my boyfriend.  </div>

<div class="text">  I've slept only two nights using this spray so far. My wife says I'm still snoring, but not so loud. It haven't been too helpful so far.  </div>

<div class="text">  If your have severely deviated septum, then it will not help you. Only surgery will. If this is not your case, this spray will be helpful. Thanks to it, you sleep peacefully, your tongue doesn't slip, mouth doesn't open. These things are dangerous, by the way.
